    "- WebAIM Survey: Lack of awareness, more accessible content more helpful better than tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do I really HAVE to?\n",
    "- It's the right thing to do.\n",
    "- It's the law (see US Law for example); you have to make your content accessible-->Your small business could be next\n",

    "\n",
    "## WCAG\n",
    "- Perceivable- by anyone or anything\n",
    "- Operable (can you operate this site using only a mouse)\n",
    "- Understandable (acronyms explained, behave in a predictable manner)\n",
    "- Robust (using well-formed HTMl and such so accessibility apps can use it)\n",
    "- \"Following these guidelines will often make your content more usable to users in general\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML 2.0\n",
    "- alt--PLEASE provide alt tages for your images\n",
    "- tabindex-- Control tab order of the element, tabindex = 0, the browser follows DOM order--> Think about people navigating by keyboard, tabindex = -1 will skip the element\n",

    "\n",
    "## Semantic Tags\n",
    "- Semantic tags are important anyway to avoid div soup\n",

    "- Accessibility API will look at your site and determine the way things are structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## ARIA: Accessible Rich Internet Applications\n",
    "- ARIA roles: disguise one element as another\n",
    "- ARIA properties such as aria-level, aria-hidden (to explain things like pop-up or things not readily visible from the mark-up)\n",

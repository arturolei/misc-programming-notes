    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "- Every JS program can define or modify the global scope\n",

    "    -JS is more verbose than Python when it comes to equivalency operator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "- Similar to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## This\n",
    "- In Python we have self, this in JS is similar to self in Python\n",
    "- Make sure have the right \"this\"\n",
    "- Arrow functions and binding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Template Literal\n",
    "- Like f-strings in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promises\n",
    "- JS is single-threaded?---What?\n",
    "- JS needs way to do AsyncIO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bad Parts\n",
    "- See *JavaScript: The Good Parts*\n",
    "- Some things you should be wary of:\n",
    "    - Global variables\n",
    "    - ==\n",
    "    - +\n",
    "    - scope\n",

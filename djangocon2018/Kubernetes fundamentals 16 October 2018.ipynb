    "# Fundamentals of Kubernetes for Django developers\n",
    "### Graham Dumpleton, 16 October 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context:\n",
    "- Kubernetes as up and coming bad thing\n",
    "- Containers are a big buzzword in last few years\n",
    "    - Containers have actually been around for a long time (Google since 2001/2002)\n",
    "    - Chroot \n",
    "    - Docker suddenly \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a container?\n",
    "- Similar to virtuailization \n",
    "    - Virtual Machine/Sandboxing--> Have another OS on your sytem--> Sort of like a virtual environment but a virtual machine\n",
    "- Containers are similar and offer protection\n",
    "- Much quicker than starting things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building an Image\n",
    "- Dockerfile is used to build an image (which contains all the bits and pieces you need, e.g. Windows, Ubuntu and instructions on how to use\n",
    "- IMage is then pushed to image registry\n",
    "- Then do \"Docker run\"---> Saves a lot of work versus past previous way (Underneath it's still old school Linux containers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems\n",
    "- Running single containers is easy\n",
    "    - Docker is great for running on one machine\n",
    "- Running multiple containers becomes problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kubernetes\n",
    "- Nodes and master nodes, multile containers? \n",
    "- Key term: Pods\n",
    "- Kubernetes automates a lot of server issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly technical, barely understood much of it. However, I have a better idea of what Kubernetes is. "

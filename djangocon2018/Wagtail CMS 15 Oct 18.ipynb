    "## Speaker: Sara Heins\n",
    "- Self-taught developer, non-traditional developer\n",

    "## What is Wagtail?\n",
    "- CMS for Admin\n",
    "- Rapid page deelopment\n",
    "- Beautiful user friendly admin\n",
    "    - It looks like WordPress Admin but with teal color scheme. \n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Not much documentation (not great)\n",
    "    - Fewer users, not many Stack Overflow stuff (Really not great, risk of potential dieoff)\n",
    "- Weird naming conventions--SnakeCase--Reliance on naming\n",
    "- Lecture went too fast, too, not quite beginner friendly as advertised--some default templates. Site has better explanation--Could not really code along with presenter\n",
    "- This sounds like something fun to try\n",
    "- Streamlined (no messing with views.py, minimal RegEx)\n",
    "- WagTail--- \n",
    "- [Website for the Slides](sheins.github.io/wagtail)\n",

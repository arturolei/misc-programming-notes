    "NB: We will not be covering everything or else we will be here forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer architecture\n",
    "- Binary representation (what does it really look like under the hood)\n",
    "- Very interactive, very exercise-based\n",
    "    - Go to [here](https://github.com/Bradfield/pybay2017) for the exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "## best way to learn computer science is to practice ##\n",
    "- Computer science is like learning French or playing tennis. Until you do the exercise, you \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a computer capable of storing? ##\n",
    "A computer can store \"bits\" (on or off). From sequences of bits and an interpretation, we somehow model data. \n",
    "NB: A byte can be considered a location in memory. 8 bits = 1 byte (da controllare)\n",
    "- Why 8 bits? 7 bits is adequate for ASCII. \n",
    "\n",
    "Octet = 8 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte = smallest unit for addressable RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "1 byte can store 2^8\n",
    "\n",
    "How many colors? \n",
    "rgb(256, 256, 256)--> three bytes of storage, 256\n",
    "\n",
    "## On 32-bit machine, how much RAM can you have? ##\n",
    "What does it meant to have a 32-bit machine? Each register (small piece of RAM) has 32-bit long address (number of bytes, 2^32, 4 billion bites). DA CONTROLLARE\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we move to 64 bits? More RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Sidenote: Look at IPv6 and how long IP addresses are (IP addresses were originally 4 bytes, 2^32 = (2^8)^4)\n",

    "NB: Cloned Github from \n",
    "\n",
    "Things to know: \n",
    "- Where does the header end and the data begins?\n",
    "- Greyscale = average of the three rgb values then take those bytes and re-write them\n",
    "- Review offset in hex and bitmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexdump is visualization of data. The left is the row number/location in data, the right is ASCII\n",

    "### Queue vs Stack: Dealing with Sequence of Data\n",
    "**Queue**\n",
    "- First In, First Out (like a line in real-life)\n",
    "**Stack**\n",
    "- Last In, First Out\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we model a queue in Python? \n",
    "- A list with insert(0) and push() OR append() and pop(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why can't we just put integers in?**\n",
    "Something about a pointer, a list comes pre-fabricated with a set number of pointers\n",
    "Items beyond that set number will force a new list to be created\n",
    "\n",
    "Does adding item to a list vary depending on length on list? Constant versus linear-time operation? \n",
    "- It's really linear (adding requires you know an index and going to the last pointer)\n",
    "- Amortized time: we assume constant time operation when it really isn't because most of time we're okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Takeaway: \"The most important thing you can do as a Python programmer is learn C. If you don't want to learn C, speak to me after,and I'll convince you to learn C.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "What about popping or removing a list? Constant or linear?\n",
    "- Constant time again\n",
    "- If you pop from beginning and add at the end at same time, you have to perform a shift (in fact), the FIFO operation is a shift operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a list gets too big, we run into a problem:\n",
    "- **Stack** vs **Heap** (DA CONTROLLARE)\n",
    "- If we have a python program, what does OS do to run it? \n",
    "    1. Allocate RAM to run it? (CPython) \n",
    "    2. Allocate RAM for the stuff in the code (variables and stuff)\n",
    "    3. Allocate some amount of RAM for stuff running\n",
    "            a) STACK = notionally structure\n",
    "                - function calls\n",
    "                - local variables\n",
    "            b) HEAP = unstructure space\n",
    "- Python and STACK/HEAP\n",
    "    -No stack overflow in Python? It goes into the heap-->If heap used up, it creates a problem\n",
    "- So if a list is too big, you run into a big problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other Considerations\n",
    "- List and nodes? Lists run out of RAM at some point?\n",
    "- Rebuffer? Finite amount of space can be used as queue (when you reach end of top value, begin again at a time and read next, problem: write over old data, but block reader from overtaking writer, and writer from overtaking reader)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun Fact: NumPy is written in C. \n",
    "\n",

    "Python has to compile and interpret (pyc). \n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python program getting slow means that you are going to RAM too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 60s, we did not care about RAM access space because our CPU's were so slow. Nowadays, we can do a billion operations per second. \n",
    "- Moore's Law (doubling of computational power, every 12 months/16 mounths)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, RAM access has not changed that much. Relative cost of doing an instruction vs accessing RAM has grown.\n",
    "\n",
    "How long does it take to execute one operation on a gigahertz machine?\n",
    "Answer: Like a billionth of a second?\n",
    "\n",
    "How long does it take to access RAM?\n",
    "Answer: Like two hundred nanoseconds. So... a bit more time; RAM is slower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a program where we are getting an average of stuff in a list.... how much time is spent calculating and how much time is spent retrieving? \n",
    "\n",
    "CPU Cache resolves part of this problem (CPU performance versus RAM performance)\n",
    "- Piece of Faster RAM closer to CPU, idea being when you go to RAM, get not just the item requested, but the other stuff in the neighborhood (cacheline)\n",
    "- Memory hierarchy idea\n",
    "- NB: Even SSD is still very slow. Hard-drive is rather slow. \n",
    "- Cache-line is about 64 bytes. It's reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The people who do NumPy and whatnot think about these things often. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the cost of sending large amounts of data?\n",
    "- Latency to New York: trying to send one packet to NY? Half speed of light-ish?, like 35 or so milliseconds\n",

    "- Sneaker rate = getting it there but on your vote\n",
    "- What does it mean when a machine has multie core? \n",
    "    - A core is an independent CPU that allows you to do stuff concurrently, like parallel. \n",
    "    - Concurrency vs. parallelism?\n",
    "        - Concurrency = illusion of parellism, that things are running at the same time.\n",
    "    - Virtual core? Hyper threading?\n",
    "    - Virtual core compete with real core for requests?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, all CPU caches are implemented in SRAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can model something more compactly (space), there are fewer cache lines (time). \n",
    "Using less RAM is a way to make things faster. \n",
    "If you are db manager system or writing a game, this is important.\n",
    "- \"If you drop a few frames in VR, does anyone know what happens? You get sick.\" If you can't work with cache lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is stuff so slow on web or allowed to be slow? \n",
    "- Latency has been an entrenched problem (however, now we're catching up)\n",
    "- However, although things are better, we still write slow code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interplay between RAM and CPU, cachelines and memory usage, are big issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python in its very nature not very efficient resource-wise. \n",
    "\n",
    "If something is around for n years, it'll be around for another n years. \n",
    "\n",
    "German Tank Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With Queue exercise, the types we use even at a high levels are limited. \n",
    "- Big O thoughts: When something is Big O(1)==something is constant with respect to size of input (it'll always be 10 seconds despite large input).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want all shake hands, how would you code the algorithm to do this? \n",
    "For each person in the line they shake hands, with each subsequent person\n",
    "\n",
    "What's worse than O(n^2)? Anything that is basically natural growth-ish. (2^n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "JS has object-type which is similar. \n",
    "Go does not have true dictionaries. \n",

    "    -If A is TRue but B is false, XOR = true\n",
    "    -If both false, XOR = false\n",
    "    - If we used OR, we get all 1's. \n",
    "    - If we used AND, we get all 0's (some distortion, something lost)\n",

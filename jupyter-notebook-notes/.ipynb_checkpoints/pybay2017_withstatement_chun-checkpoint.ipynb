    "# Get with it: gain the wherewithal to understand Python's with statement & context managers by Wesley Chun, 8/13/17\n",
    "\n",
    "Content of Talk:\n",
    "- Historical motivation\n",
    "- With Statement\n",
    "- Intro to Context managers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Context: \n",
    "- There have been more than several ways of reading and opening files since the inception of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2002:\n",
    "-universal newline support (PEP 278)\n",
    "- More iterators \n",
    "\n",
    "2006: \n",
    "- Debut of with statement\n",
    "- ```python with open```\n",
    "\n",
    "2008: \n",
    "- With statement fully integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "2009: \n",
    "- newlines = None, Universal newline\n",
    "\n",
    "2009-Present\n",
    "- Much clearer version\n",
    "- There's been a gradual form of things\n",
    "\n",
    "```python with``` statement allows you to open and close without the close statement. \n",
    "- If you code in Python 2, you might want to import with open from the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the with statement:\n",
    "- logic to allocate resource\n",
    "- suite\n",
    "- logic to release resource\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem here is that it adds additional complexicatiy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the With Statement\n",
    "-Push most logic for both to context manger\n",
    "   - Simplify allocation\n",
    "   - Hide releasing of resource\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Context Management:\n",
    "- Context manager handles stuff you don't want to worry about as app developer\n",
    "- Start when you get it\n",
    "- Context manager handles logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Context manager with files is farily easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Locks even simpler\n",
    "- From \n",
    "    - lock.acquire()\n",
    "    - lock.release()\n",
    " -To: \n",
    "     - With lock:\n",
    "     \n",
    "With statement greatly simplifies code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inital Context Managers:\n",
    "- file\n",
    "- decimal.Context\n",
    "- thread.LockType\n",
    "- threading.Loc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing Context Managers\n",
    "Old School:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "url = 'http://python.org'\n",
    "u = urlib.urlopen(URL)\n",
    "print u.readline()\n",
    "u.close \n",
    "```\n",
    "Goal:\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "- Context management simplifies plumbling code\n",

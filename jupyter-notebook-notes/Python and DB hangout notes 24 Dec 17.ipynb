    " - Author\n",
    " - Title\n",
    " - Edition (publisher, year), \n",
    " - Language\n",
    " - Acquisition details (retailer, circumstances)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Django**\n",
    "- \"Batteries included\" --> When you install Django, very little else you need to do to make a basic website (production ready database not included); virtually everything you need to start (ORM, routing)\n",
    "- Wordpress but for programmers/developers\n",
    "- LImited customizability but fulfills 70% of basic needs\n",
    "- By the time you are done with Djangogirls you have a login, user table (like a WP-admin, list of people and their accesses)\n",
    "- Like a framework and a CMS\n",

    "**Flask**\n",
    "- \"Batteries NOT included\": you have to do more work, find a database driver, etc\n",

    "## Some Types of DB's (Relational, Hierarchical, Graph):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relational Database**: Most of the time when we talk about databases\n",
    "- See Michael Stonebraker, [\"the Red Book\"](http://www.redbook.io/)\n",
    "- Modeling not just data but the data's relationship to other table (key and then values, each piece of that data may or may not have relationship to data in other table)\n",
    "- Relationship data is qualified\n",
    "- **ACID Test** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,Durability) : \n",
    "    - Atomicity: insert into a database, that insert is its own thing, each transaction is finite/discrete/individually--> It can be subtracted from the whole without affecting the whole\n",
    "    - Consistency: Database management guarantees what you see is what you get\n",
    "    - Isolation: No such thing as \"dirty read/write\"; things do not happen in parallel--> Serialization by necessity  \n",
    "    - Durability: Not losing data-->ways to ensure things that are never lost or are backed-up--> Transactions integrity, data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Database**:\n",
    "- Case Study: Bob's company did modeling of molecules--> way to search db of molecular modeling--> Go down \"Carbon\"--> Then specific branches--> In short a series of decisions or sieve\n",
    "- Certain types of data have precedence or determine the path you take for data\n",
    "- Relational databases are \"flatter\"; more or less you can navigate anywhere\n",
    "- Not good at relations, but better at categorization\n",
    "- Breadth of search vs depth of search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Database**:\n",
    "- Connectors are more important than the database\n",
    "- The relationship is more important the data (connectors over nodes)\n",
    "- Graph theory but with databases!\n",
    "    - e.g. GraphQL or Firebase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documents Database**:\n",
    "- A file drawer with manilla folders; each manila folder contains documents\n",
    "- Series of documents, a series of collections\n",
    "- If you do not care about missing data or relations, Documents db buy flexibility in notion in idea of having collections of documents\n",
    "- e.g. MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed SQL**:\n",
    "- Take a relational database and spread it across multiple databases. \n",
    "    - See CloudSpanner\n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Store**:\n",
    "- 90 degrees transform of relational database (pivot table)\n",
    "- Google \"Big Query\" or \"Amazon Athena\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**In-Memory**:\n",
    "- Db stored on RAM chips \n",
    "\n",
    "## No-SQL Revolt of the Early 2000s:\n",
    "- Circa 2002, there was a movement toward no-SQL db, non-relational db's that do not pass the ACID test\n",
    "- Databases that do not use SQL as an access language\n",
    "    - e.g. MongoDB or  Cassandra\n",
    "- However, it's far easier to use SQL as an access language rather than creating your own (Note: MongoDB uses Javascript natively)\n",
    "- SQL is, however, road-tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: Python and SQLite3 DB:\n",
    "What is the cursor() object in the following bit of code? A cursor is like a generator object; an object returned from the database that can only go forward. This is why we have an ORM, which give us an easier way to handle the data, does not require as much unpacking or data conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect('stocks.db') \n",
    "c = conn.cursor() \n",
    "\n",
    "# Create table c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks              (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert a row of data\n",
    "c.execute(\"INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)\") \n",
    "\n",
    "# Save (commit) the changes conn.commit()  \n",
    "\n",
    "for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks ORDER BY price'):\n",
    "    print(row) #If we wanted to use this data, we would have to manipulate it or convert it. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Once c.excute goes through, you're going to get an object which we might not be able to use\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can also close the connection if we are done with it. \n",
    "# Just be sure any changes have been committed or they will be lost. \n",

    "# PyBay 2017 Keynote: Hettinger\n",
    "**Note: the slides et. al. for this talk will be available online. Question [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3967849/pybay2017_keynote/_build/html/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More or less, this talk will be technical in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Martelli Model of Scaleability:\n",
    "- 1 core: singe thread and single process\n",
    "- 2-8 cores: multiple threads and multiple processes\n",
    "- 9+ cores: distributed processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Martelli observation: as time goes on, the second category becomes less common and relevant. Single cores become more powerful. Big datasets grow ever larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "More or less, this talk will be technical in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "Cpython has a lock for its internal shared global state. \n",
    "No more than one thread can rut at a time. \n",
    "GIL is apparently some limitation that has been removed. Performance costs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is unpopular in gaming comunity (core limitations); gamers is about maximizing what every core can do; Python not good at using multiple cores/threads (Python was closed to gaming)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads vs Processes:\n",
    "\"Your weakness is your strength and your strength is your weakness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of thread is shared state; weakness of shared state is thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes has independence but do not have a shared statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads vs Async\n",
    "Switch pre-emptively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads \n",
    "Threads switch prempitively\n",
    "- Critical sections have to guarded with locks (do things, then not do things)\n",
    "    -locks are not easy to use. \n",
    "    \n",
    "If you do not need 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async IO\n",
    "Threads switch pre-emptively\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock: global state constantly updating\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading works with existing code\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incredibly technical. Threading is good for async. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency example:\n",
    "-Threading example, check site later\n",
    "    - python```note threading.Thread(target - worker).start()```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Writing multiple threaded code can be difficult and problematic. Be careful.*\n",
    "- See Raymond's Rules of Coding \n",
    "    - A and B need to happen sequentially\n",
    "    - Barrier: parallel threads launched (every multi-threading problem has a corollary in real world)\n",
    "- Python has something called Queue module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Addendum Lip:\n",
    "\n",
    "We like processes because we can kill them. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Everything is excited about the internet of things except for me. I see bugs in code all the time.”\n",
    "When there is a bug in the logic of my self-driving car, it’s going to be bad for the person standing in front of the car.\n",
    "… I’d like to develop a higher and higher aversion. Prefer that code be programming with async code rather than multithreading code.\n",
    "“Put both Step A and Step B into the same thread, and they will happen sequentially again.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need a global variable to communicate between functions. Global variables wor kgreat for this purpose in a single threaded program. iN mult-threaded code, its mutable global state is a disaster. The better solution is to use a threading.local() that is global WITHIN a thread but not without.\n",
    "\n",
    "RR 1005: Never try to kill a thread from something external to taht thread. You never know if that thread is holding a lock. Python doesn't provide a direct mechanism for kill threads externally; however, you can do it using ctypes, but that is a recipe for a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've got shared state, you've got race conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you kill a thread, you've got no idea if it's got a lock or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locks are hard to use in bigger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you put enough locks into your program, eventually you throw away the... advantages of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "People multithread, get a race condition. Put in locks, ends up being slower."

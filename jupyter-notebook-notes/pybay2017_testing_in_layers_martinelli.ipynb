    "Why test software?\n",
    "- Not going to be covered today. \n",
    "- Python in a Nutshell will cover nutshell. \n",
    "- Today's presentation is on how to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we test?\n",
    "- Ancient Way: White-Box (we know what is in the box), Block-Box (no idea what is in module being tested)\n",
    "- Too-Close Modern Way:\n",
    "    - Unit-Test: \"White Boxy\" where developer knows stuff\n",
    "    - Integreation-Test: end-to-end, testing everything\n",
    "        -Human component: if human involved, there is QA\n",
    "- Let us define tests as being something automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices: Layers\n",
    "- Unit tests(fast, run all te time)\n",
    "    - Strictly on internal logic\n",
    "    - Mock out \"every\" dependency\n",
    "    - Fast (almost) \"above all\"\n",
    "        - fast unit tests so you don't get a delay in knowing that there is a problem; feedback should be fast enough to match your work pace or the context \n",
    "        - See story of Python text candidate\n",
    "- Higher-layer tests\n",
    "- Pattern Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentals of Testing\n",
    "- All tests should be reproducible:\n",
    "    - If any randomness, for ce a seed\n",
    "    - If depends on currnet time of day, must fake time\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we test lower-level module like database adapter? (things that do not depend on your system)\n",
    "- Pure Unit Test: mock out DB\n",
    "    - Fine if we understand db 100%\n",
    "    - Little pieces test\n",
    "- 2nd Layer int-test: fake (emulated) DB\n",
    "    - local.comtrolled, maybe in mem (build a fake)\n",
    "    - Including semantic constraints\n",
    "    \n",
    "The image was hard to understand given that the lighting was not working. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Body of Tests\":\n",
    "- Core reusable part\n",
    "    - Exercises all meaningful paths\n",
    "    - Including \"simulated\" errors\n",
    "- Opt folowed by for mocks/spies)\n",
    "    - Check of calls, arguments (make sure test input and assert calls are okay)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Mocks aren't fake:\n",
    "- Test Doubles: [Martin Fowler site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)\n",
    "- Dummy, fake, stub, spy, mock, ... \n",
    "- A key issue: who owns/maintains\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a complete program if it does not come with an emulator that lets your run the program without running tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mocks vs Fakes\n",
    "- Mock: flexibly simulate anything\n",
    "    - depending on tests' calls on it\n",
    "    - spies: lets you check calls, arrgs... \n",
    "- Fake: fast, limited emulation\n",
    "    -Of a specific component.module\n",
    "    \n",
    "Testing HLB\n",
    "- Pure unit test:  MLB, MLCC\n",
    "- Second Layer int-test: actual MLB, MLC\n",
    "    -Mock DBa, DNSa, mock or real LL2\n",
    "- Third layer i-t: act\n",
    "- Mixture of mock and actual\n",
    "\n",
    "Use mock, fake, or actual module?\n",
    "- Mock: fastest, least accurate\n",
    "- Actual: least work, if fast enough\n",
    "    - Design it to be primeable for speed\n",
    "- Fake: Best but probably complex\n",
    "    -Check complexity\n",
    "        -e.g. DNS module- what kind of DNS records?\n",
    "            - Often: essential just A records, DN-->IP\n",
    "                - Trivial to mock or fake\n",
    "                - Maybe: CNAME, HINFO, MX, NS\n",
    "                \n",
    "Load-test in layers:\n",
    "- Actual elapsed-time measuresments need end-to-end code paths\n",
    "- Intermediate tests you can get (t) time\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Body of Tests\" for Load-Testing\n",
    "- Not the same as for other tests\n",
    "    - Take caorrect ness forg granted\n",
    "    - Exercise performance-critical bits\n",
    "- Usually best to separate for easier elapsed-tme measurement\n",

    "Testing Refactoring:\n",
    "    - Refactoring = changing internal structure, but keeping output the same\n",
    "    - Within a module: base case\n",
    "        - edit test-bodies to maitnain coverage (you still test for the same things)\n",
    "        - also all mockses or fakes should maintain coverage (you still test for the same things)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Moving functionality between mdodles\n",
    "        - Check that unit-tests now fail\n",
    "        - edit test-bodies, mocksfakes to pass\n",
    "        - run intermediate int-tests of higher levels\n",
    "Book Recommendation: Feathers' **Working with Legacy Code**\n",
    "    - Legacy in this sence is a code without tests\n",
    "        - Big Conclusion: If code does not have tests built in, build tests\n",
    "        \n",
    "Tests and Logging:\n",
    "- Unit-tests must be fast\n",
    "    - Check only what can be checked rapidly\n",
    "    - For everything else:\n",
    "        - log/snapshot status in detail\n",
    "        - run batch/background jobs to check\n",
    "- batch sanity checks on logs/snaps: good idea\n",
    "    - batch sanity checks can really save your bacon in some occasions. \n",
    "        - sampling even on production runs? \n",
    "    - including non-ntesting productions runs\n",
    "    \n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "Q: If you're not mocking everything out, you cannot tell where the failure is happens. What do we do?\n",
    "A: You should have isolated components doing unit-tests correctly. First order of business is making \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Primeable for speed? Using actual dependency?\n",
    "A: If you have a low-level module\n"

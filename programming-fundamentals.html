	<p>
		Knowing how to program is not the same as knowing how to program in a specific language. Programming as a way of thinking, a way of conceptualizing the world. 

		Here are some ways programming languages differ:
		-Syntax (the grammar, how you write things and certain structures)
		-Usage--How is the languaeg used?
		-Level-->How close are you to the hardware? C is considered one of the lowest (closest to the machine)
		-Compiled/Interpreted--> R and Python are interpreted (we work through as we go it) whereas C and Java need to be compiled (checked for errors then run)
		-Object-oriented/Functional programming

		So how should we start? What language do you want to learn?
		-Skopos-->To what end do you want to learn a language?

	<p>You're going to spend a hell of a lot of time debugging code that you have written. StackOverflow will be your new best friend. Google will be your other new best friend</p>

	<p>Print statements will be your friend.</p>

	<p>OS a body or suite of programs that make what we do nice.</p>

	<p>Unix has more rigorous security. OSX is UNIX!!! (see D-lab notes for more difference)</p>

	<p>Linux is free and open source Unix-like operating</p>

	<p> UNIX has 1) a kernel, the hub of everything. 2) the shell interprets commands given to machine by us. 3) file system/hierarchical director story, root directory at the top. 

	<strong>Command Line Interface</strong>

	The Shell: we are sending commands to the shell, the shell is more or less an interpreter. The shell encloses the operating system to hide some of the complexity.

	<p>BASH-Boure Again Shell-->derived from name of creator Bourne

	Why do we use shell? Comine existing tools with only a few keystrokes. 

	Easiest way to interact with remote machines-->the machines do the crunching far away so we don't have to waste our laptop doing the work.

	Directories = folders

	Usual style

	(command) (flag/a thing with a hyphen) (files or directories, could be multiple or one)

	A command might require no files. 

	ls -F, adds a trailing / to indicate that something is a folder/directory. 

	man ls-->returns manual or description of ls (Mac)

	If you got ls --help

	Absolute vs Relative path
	-->Absolute path is starting from root directory, relative is dependent on where the hell you are. 

	Change directory. = cd

	ls -a, what does the -a flag do? It stands for "reveal all"	
	cd ~, takes you home, to the home directory. 

	NB: Tab completion, if you beginning typing a path out, you can press tab to complete the thing.
